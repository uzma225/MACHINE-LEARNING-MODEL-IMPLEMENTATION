# DESCRIPTION
In this task, I built a machine learning model using the Scikit-learn library to classify or predict outcomes based on a dataset. The goal of this task is to understand how machine learning works and how we can train a model to make predictions on new data.
To start, I selected a dataset suitable for a classification or prediction problem. For example:

Spam Email Detection

Iris Flower Classification

Titanic Survival Prediction

Diabetes Progression Prediction

These datasets are publicly available on websites like Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Using libraries like pandas, I loaded the dataset and began exploring it to understand:

The types of data (numeric, categorical)

Any missing or incorrect values

Basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)

This helped identify any cleaning or preprocessing needed before modeling.

Preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values (e.g., filling or removing them)

Encoding categorical variables (e.g., using OneHotEncoder or LabelEncoder)

Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler for normalization)

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80/20 or 70/30)

These steps ensure the model can learn effectively and generalize well on unseen data.

I chose a machine learning algorithm from Scikit-learn such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The model was trained using the training dataset, allowing it to learn patterns between the input features and the target output.

The modelâ€™s performance was tested on the testing dataset using metrics like:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

Once the model was trained and evaluated, I used it to make predictions on new or test data. I analyzed whether the predictions made sense and reflected the expected outcomes.

Through this task, I gained practical experience in building machine learning models using Python. I learned how to handle real-world data, train and evaluate models, and make predictions effectively.
